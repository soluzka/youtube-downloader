# Locate this section in cipher.py
function_patterns = [
    r'a\.[a-zA-Z]+\s*&&\s*\([a-zA-Z]+\s*=\s*a\.get\("n"\)\)\s*&&.*?||\s*([a-zA-Z]+)',
    # Add other patterns if necessary
]
# Ensure the rest of the code remains unchanged
# python download_youtube_yt_dlp.py
# python download_youtube.py
# node download-yt-dlp.js
# ffmpeg -i "http://example.com/video.mp4" output.mp3
# ffmpeg -i "C:\path\to\your file.mp4" output.mp3
# Run this after you add the url in the java script. node downloadVideo.js
# Lifecycle scripts in package.json are predefined script names that npm executes automatically at specific stages during the lifecycle of a package. Here are some common lifecycle scripts you can define: npm init -y
